# 👨🏻‍💻 Customer Shopping  Analysis– Data Analyst Project
This is my personal end-to-end data analytics project, built to demonstrate how I approach real-world business problems as a data analyst — from raw data to actionable insights.
The project follows an industry-style analytics workflow, covering data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting, with a strong focus on business decision-making rather than just tools.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns and extract insights that can help businesses:
Understand customer segments
Identify loyalty and retention drivers
Analyze purchasing behavior and trends
Support data-driven strategic decisions
This project reflects how I would work on an analytics problem in a professional environment.
